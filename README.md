# OCServo_App
## App Designed for working with OCServo servos

How it works:
1. Pick a port and open it
2. You can pick mode (write and sync write working)
3. Input servo id and desired position
4. You can also optionally pick an operation time (if too low servo goes max speed) and press send
5. You can at any moment press read to get the current position of the servo
6. On/off button turns the servo torque on and off, same goes for "feet off", and "X leg off" buttons

Another 2 modes TBD.
